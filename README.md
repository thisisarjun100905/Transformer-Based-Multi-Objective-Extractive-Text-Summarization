# 🌟 Transformer-Based Multi-Objective Extractive Text Summarization

![Summary Icon](https://via.placeholder.com/100)  
*Effortlessly create high-quality summaries optimized for coverage and redundancy.*

---

## 📖 Introduction  
With an ever-growing abundance of text data, this project addresses the challenge of **automatic text summarization (ATS)** using cutting-edge technologies. By combining **transformer-based models** and **multi-objective optimization**, the system generates concise, informative summaries that balance content richness and minimal redundancy.  

🔑 **Key Highlights**:  
- Optimized sentence selection with **NSGA-II**.  
- Enhanced contextual understanding using **Sentence-BERT**.  
- Comprehensive evaluation using **ROUGE metrics**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance coverage and redundancy using advanced genetic algorithms.  
✅ **State-of-the-Art NLP Models**: Incorporates transformer-based embeddings for superior semantic understanding.  
✅ **Quantitative Metrics**: Evaluated on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores for reliable performance validation.

## 🛠 Methodology  
### **1️⃣ Text Preprocessing**  
- **Tokenization**: Break text into manageable pieces.  
- **Cleaning & Stemming**: Remove irrelevant elements and unify word forms.  

### **2️⃣ Sentence Representation**  
- **Embedding**: Represent sentences as vectors using Sentence-BERT.  
- **Similarity Matrix**: Calculate contextual similarity between sentences using cosine similarity.
### **3️⃣ Optimization with NSGA-II**  
- Generates decision vectors for sentence inclusion.  
- Outputs Pareto-optimal solutions balancing coverage and redundancy.  

### **4️⃣ Evaluation**  
- Compare summaries using ROUGE metrics:  
  - 🔹 **ROUGE-1**: Word overlap.  
  - 🔹 **ROUGE-2**: Bi-gram overlap.  
  - 🔹 **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence.
